# ðŸ‘‹ Wishocracy

## Problems Wishocracy Solves

1. Optimal Allocation of Finite Resources - Simple Direct Democracy does not prioritize resource allocation as effectively as being forced to prioritize spending of a given budget. There are an infinite number of good ideas that could all pass an up-down vote, but the world has limited resources.  Wishocracy forces its Citizens to prioritize the most important ones.
2. Misaligned Interests - The interests of representatives in a Representative Democracy do not match the interests of all Citizens.  For instance, in the US, one of the most democratic representative governments, 80% to 90% of citizens disapprove of the way Congress allocates resources.  One [study](https://act.represent.us/sign/problempoll-fba/) showed that "The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy." The interests of a Wishocracratic government are identical to the interests of its citizens.
3. Duplication of Effort - Multiple DAOs often have similar needs.  For instance, there are many projects working to enable people to collect, analyze and share their health data.  Instead of sharing the cost burden for building the required features, many are all building the exact same features in private code bases.  Wishocracy pools shared resources to minimize waste and accelerate progress.
4. AI Safety - Artificial Intelligence holds great promise for humanity, including the potential to destroy it.  The commonly proposed solution is government regulation.  However, governments are also a form of artificial intelligence.  They are complex systems without a physical brain that process and analyze large amounts of data in order to make decisions and take action.  Studies have shown that these "GovGPTs" also have very little alignment with the interests of the average human.  Unlike ChatGPT, they've already proven that they have the capability and will to murder [up to a billion humans](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/books/chapters/what-every-person-should-know-about-war.html) throughout their history. A global Wishocracy could serve as a perfectly human interest-aligned regulator of all AI systems.
5. Better Decisions through Knowledge Aggregation - We've seen time and time again that those thought to be the greatest experts can make disastrous policies. The most recent examples include central bankers [destroying currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation) and harming economies, foreign affairs experts conducting military attacks that [decrease national security](https://www.gale.com/terrorism), drug policy experts criminalizing the prescription of safer painkillers [leading to an epidemic of Fentanyl overdoses](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/war-on-drugs-fueled-fentanyl-crisis), and on and on.  The book The [Wisdom of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wisdom\_of\_Crowds) has many examples proving that the combined knowledge of many people is likely to produce better decisions than even the smartest experts.&#x20;
6. Limited Attention - In representative democracies, political decisions are based on tribal loyalties to a far great extent than optimizing policies.

## How it Works

### $WISHes

Every member of a Wishocratic DAO receives a universal basic income of 1 $WISH per day.&#x20;

### Wishing Wells&#x20;

If a Citizen has a wish, they can create a Wishing Well (similar to a feature request or a crowdfunding campaign) which describes their Wish, or search for an existing Wishing Well for the same Wish.  Once they find or create their Wishing Well, they can throw their $WISH(es) in the Wishing Well (known as staking in DeFi).
