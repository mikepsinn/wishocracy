## Problems Wishocracy Solves

1. Optimal Allocation of Finite Resources - Simple Direct Democracy does not prioritize resource allocation as effectively as being forced to prioritize spending of a given budget. There are an infinite number of good ideas that could all pass an up-down vote, but the world has limited resources.  Wishocracy forces its Citizens to prioritize the most important ones.
2. Misaligned Interests - The interests of representatives in a Representative Democracy do not match the interests of all Citizens.  For instance, in the US, one of the most democratic representative governments, 80% to 90% of citizens disapprove of the way Congress allocates resources.  One [study](https://act.represent.us/sign/problempoll-fba/) showed that "The preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy." The interests of a Wishocracratic government are identical to the interests of its citizens.
3. Duplication of Effort - Multiple DAOs often have similar needs.  For instance, there are many projects working to enable people to collect, analyze and share their health data.  Instead of sharing the cost burden for building the required features, many are all building the exact same features in private code bases.  Wishocracy pools shared resources to minimize waste and accelerate progress.
4. AI Safety - Artificial Intelligence holds great promise for humanity, including the potential to destroy it.  The commonly proposed solution is government regulation.  However, governments are also a form of artificial intelligence.  They are complex systems without a physical brain that process and analyze large amounts of data in order to make decisions and take action.  Studies have shown that these "GovGPTs" also have very little alignment with the interests of the average human.  Unlike ChatGPT, they've already proven that they have the capability and will to murder [up to a billion humans](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/books/chapters/what-every-person-should-know-about-war.html) throughout their history. A global Wishocracy could serve as a perfectly human interest-aligned regulator of all AI systems.
5. Inadequate Knowlege of Representatives - We've seen time and time again that those thought to be the greatest experts can make disastrous policies. The most recent examples include central bankers [destroying currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation) and harming economies, foreign affairs experts conducting military attacks that [decrease national security](https://www.gale.com/terrorism), drug policy experts criminalizing the prescription of safer painkillers [leading to an epidemic of Fentanyl overdoses](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/29/war-on-drugs-fueled-fentanyl-crisis), and on and on.  The book The [Wisdom of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wisdom\_of\_Crowds) has many examples proving that the combined knowledge of many people is likely to produce better decisions than even the smartest experts.&#x20;
6. Media Time Wasted on Personalities Instead of Issues - On average, a person spends approximately 5-10 minutes per day consuming news specifically related to political issues. The majority of these minutes consist of news related to politiciansâ€™ personal lives and controversies rather than substantive policy discussions. This leads to an inadequate understanding of the pros and cons of the policies that actually impact society. The terrible result is that, in representative democracies, political decisions are based on tribal loyalties to a far great extent than optimizing policies. In a Wishocracy, there would be no need for politicians.  Thus 100% of this media consumption could be devoted to policy, leading to a more informed population.

## How it Works

### $WISHes

Every member of a Wishocratic DAO receives a universal basic income of 1 $WISH per day.&#x20;

### Wishing Wells&#x20;

If a Citizen has a wish, they can create a Wishing Well (similar to a feature request or a crowdfunding campaign) which describes their Wish, or search for an existing Wishing Well for the same Wish.  Once they find or create their Wishing Well, they can throw their $WISH(es) in the Wishing Well (known as staking in DeFi).

## The Wishocracatic Constitution

### Article 1: Wishocratic Government

#### Section 1: The Establishment of the Wishocratic Government

It is established as a new form of government in which every individual (Wisher) is granted one $WISH per day.

#### Section 2: The Wishing Wells&#x20;

For each new $WISH submitted, a Wishing Well is created.

The Wishing Well is the central repository for all $WISH associated with that particular Wish.&#x20;

If multiple people have the same Wish, they may contribute their $WISH to the same Wishing Well.

#### Section 3: Genie DAOs&#x20;

Genie DAOs are comprised of any combination of businesses, nonprofits, governments, or individuals.

Genie DAOs may apply to receive $WISH from a specific Wishing Well to fulfill a Wish.

Genie DAOs must include both a GPI Lead Measure and a GPI Lag Measure in their proposals.

#### Section 4: Granting of Wishes

If a majority of Wishers vote that a particular Genie DAO has fulfilled a Wish, those fulfilling the given $WISH grant all $WISH in the Wishing Well.

#### &#x20;Section 5: GPI Lead and Lag Measures

A GPI Lead Measure is a predictive and proactive indicator of future performance that the performer can influence or control. It represents the activities and strategies that can be implemented to achieve the desired outcome and is measured to determine progress toward the goal.\


A GPI Lag Measure is a retrospective and reactive indicator of past performance, representing the outcomes that have already occurred and cannot be influenced or controlled by the performer. These measures are useful for evaluating whether the end goal has been accomplished.

The formula for both the GPI Lead Measure and GPI Lag Measure, as well as the method of collecting the data, will be concretely defined before the approval of a Genie DAO contract.\


The current price of the $WISH tokens after tax and the number of wishes in the wishing well would dictate to which degree the lag measure would affect society.

### Article 2: The Individual Rights and Freedoms

#### Section 1: The Right to Wishes&#x20;

Every individual has the right to submit one $WISH per day to a specific Wishing Well.

#### Section 2: Non-discrimination&#x20;

No $WISH is allowed to discriminate against race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, or disability.

### Article 3: The Government Structure

#### Section 1: The Administration of the Wishocratic Government&#x20;

The Wishocratic Government is administered through direct democracy of Wishers.

Each Wisher has an equal vote in all matters related to the administration of the Wishocratic Government.

#### Section 2: The Selection of Genies&#x20;

There is no Genie council in the Wishocratic Government.&#x20;

All decisions related to the administration of the Wishocratic Government are made through the direct democracy of Wishers.

#### Section 3: The Powers of the Wishers

The Wishers have the power to oversee the operation of the Wishing Wells and grant $WISH to Genie DAOs.

The Wishers also have the power to make rules and regulations necessary for the proper administration of the Wishocratic Government.

### Article 4: The Amendments

#### Section 1: Amendment Process&#x20;

The Constitution is amended by a two-thirds vote majority of the Wishers.&#x20;

Any proposed amendment is submitted in writing to the Wishers for consideration.

#### Section 2: Amendment Ratification&#x20;

If at least two-thirds of the Wishers approve the proposed amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.

The Constitution is the supreme law of the Wishocratic Government and all individuals and entities within its jurisdiction are bound by it.

### Article 5: The Allocation of Wishes

#### Section 1: The Token Holders

Each Genie DAO shall be issued a redeemable fractionalized token, which shall be auctioned to interested parties. Upon completion of a lead measure, the tokens shall be instantly airdropped to the token holders. Each token shall entitle the holder to one wish from the associated Genie DAO.

#### Section 2: The Genie DAO and the Wishers

The remaining wishes shall be allocated as follows: half of the wishes shall be granted to the Genie DAO that successfully completed the lead measure, and the other half shall be granted to the Wishers who cast wishes into the wishing well. The wishes granted to the Wishers shall be distributed proportionally to the number of wishes they cast

### Article 7: Limitations on Wishes

#### Section 1: Prohibition of Unlimited $WISH Requests

Wishers are strictly forbidden from wishing for an unlimited amount of $WISH. Such requests would disrupt the balance of the Wishocratic economy and lead to wish hyperinflation, jeopardizing the entire system.

#### Section 2: Consequences of Unclaimed $WISH

If a Wisher fails to claim their daily $WISH, it will be removed from circulation and considered "burned." In addition, a Wishonian Fairy will be publicly and brutally executed to emphasize the importance of claiming one's daily $WISH and maintaining the stability of the Wishocratic system.
